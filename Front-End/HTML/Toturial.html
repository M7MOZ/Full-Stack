            local path -> second example, we just added the folder name that is besides the html file on the left then the name of the image after it including the extension (.png).
                what if my image is outside the folder holding the html file? -> third example, but not a good choice to make it like that.
            you can use two attributes (Width and Height) but i don't recommend that, the better is to costmize them in CSS -> first example.
