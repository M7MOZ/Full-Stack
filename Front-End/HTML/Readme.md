# HTML Tutorial

## Elements

- ### General to all Elements
  
  - Our code in html is case insensitive.
  - every element has opening and closing tags like  `<html>` (opening) `</html>` (closing).
  - but there are elements that is self closed like `<meta />` and `<b />`.

- ### Comments

   Comments are written like this
  
    ```html
    <!-- Comments --> 
    ```

    and this for both single and multi-line comments
    and we write them when we write code that isn't completely clear or new to this language, Comments helps you and your teammates to understand your code very well.

- ### DOCTYPE
  
   DocType is not an element but it's an instruction for
    the browser, for example

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ```

    is referred for HTML5 standard mode and this line is important (Must be written) and without it browser will run the page in [quirks mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode).

- ### HTML Tag

    The HTML tag is the root of any webPage, and written like this:

    ```html
    <html>
      Some Content  
    </html> 
    ```
